## Hi I'm Darxoon

### Interests

My main interests are in Game Development, reverse engineering how programs work and trying to use Programming Languages in interesting ways.

### My Projects

* [(WIP) An audio only RPG](https://github.com/Darxoon/AudioStory)
* [LineRandomizer](https://github.com/Darxoon/LineRandomizer)
* [Pitradio (a WIP Project for PIT Hackathon I took part in)](https://github.com/lukaslangrock/pitradio)
* [TOKElfTool: A program for modding Paper Mario: The Origami King](https://github.com/Darxoon/TOKElfTool)

### Origami Wand
The project I'm currently mainly working on is a rewrite of [TOKElfTool](https://github.com/Darxoon/TOKElfTool) in Svelte. It will support many QoL improvements that would be too complicated to do in WPF and more file types.

# Have a look at sea slugs.
