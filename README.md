## Hi I'm Darxoon

### Interests

My main interests are in Game Development, reverse engineering how programs work and trying to use Programming Languages in interesting ways. One of my most notable contributions is my work in the Paper Mario: The Origami King modding scene, where I significantly advanced the modding scene with [TOKElfTool](https://github.com/Darxoon/TOKElfTool) and other Research efforts.

### My Projects

* [(WIP) An audio only RPG](https://github.com/Darxoon/AudioStory)
* [LineRandomizer](https://github.com/Darxoon/LineRandomizer)
* [Pitradio (a WIP Project for PIT Hackathon I took part in)](https://github.com/lukaslangrock/pitradio)
* [TOKElfTool: A program for modding Paper Mario: The Origami King](https://github.com/Darxoon/TOKElfTool)
* [BorderlessEverything: A program to make any program a borderless window](https://github.com/Darxoon/BorderlessEverything) (forked by Mr. Technician's BorderlessMinecraft)

### Infini-Toe
A side project I'm working on at the moment is Infini-Toe. It's the classic game Tic Tac Toe, which is also known as Noughts and Crosses, but infinite. Instead of a standard 3x3 grid, it plays off on an infinitely large grid. The game also has no ending, thus making it temporally infinite too. The game contains many more alterations from the standard game, in order to make it work with an infinitely large board and no fixed match end. It will support local multiplayer and online multiplayer.

### Origami Wand
The project I'm currently mainly working on is a rewrite of [TOKElfTool](https://github.com/Darxoon/TOKElfTool) in Svelte. It will support many QoL improvements that would be too complicated to do in WPF and it will contain a lot more many and more complex file types types.
